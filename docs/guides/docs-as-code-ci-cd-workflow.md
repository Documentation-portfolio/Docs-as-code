## Overview
This document outlines how to configure, validate, build, and publish documentation using a Docs-as-Code approach. It serves as a guide to create a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for your documentation team. The workflow uses **Docusaurus** as the Node-based static site generator, **GitHub** for version-control, and **GiHub Pages** for deployment.
