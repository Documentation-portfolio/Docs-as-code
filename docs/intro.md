# Documentation Portfolio by Riya

Hi! 
I created this documentation portfolio using Docs-as-Code approach, where documentation is built, tested, reviewed, and deployed just like software. I created this documentation porfolio using Docusaurus and deployed it via GitHub Pages. I built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that covers:
1. Automated content quality checks for every push or pull request:
    - Link verification 
    - Content formatting using Prettier
    - Content standards and consistency using markdownlint
2. Automated a preview build of a document for every pull request.
3. Automated build and deployment of the final documentation site every time changes are merged to the main branch.


#### Tools & Technologies Used
- Docusaurus 3 for the documentation site framework
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
- GitHub Pages for automated hosting and deployments
- markdownlint, Prettier, and docusaurus linkchecker for quality validation
- Node.js 20+ for the build environment
- Netlify for PR previews
- Version control using Git
- Visual Studio Code as the primary authoring and development editor
