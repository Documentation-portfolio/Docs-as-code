# Documentation Portfolio: Docs-as-code CI/CD workflow

## Overview
I have created this documentation using Docusaurus and deployed via GitHub Pages. 

I have created a basic CI/CD pipeline for documentation workflow that covers the following:
1. Preview a document every time a PR is raised
2. Build and publish the final version of the document every time a branch is merged to the main branch.
